They never have a specific target in mind. Technology immigrants or those who are distracted generally tend to end up taking the bait.\n When Jason Cameron received a phone call from someone claiming to work for his Internet security provider, he was surprised to hear something could be wrong with his new laptop. %%1%%. Yet, the woman on the other side claimed they had tracked a virus to his computer. He couldn’t remember updating his virus protection software recently, so he thought that must have been the problem. \n  ‘The woman told me to download some software so that she would be able to access my computer remotely and she could remove the virus,’ he said. ‘Once I had downloaded it, she asked me to pay a fee into a PayPal account.’ %%2%%. ‘I willingly did it because I thought to myself she might be able to fix my computer quickly, he said.

After restarting it, I noticed my files were missing. The thieves must have hacked into my computer. It must have happened while I was unable to use it,’ she reports. ‘I shouldn’t have installed software that came from a suspicious link and instead I should have marked the email as spam,’ she said, ‘I could have avoided all this mess.’"
